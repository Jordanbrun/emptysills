# Empty Sills
Gardening is a lot more then just watering plants every day. Caring for plants requires an individual care plan for each species which reflects their individual needs. In the past, gardeners have kept journals where they store their research as well as dates to when their plants neets to be properly cared for. Empty Sills hopes to update this old system by providing both information and care plans to users in the palm of their hand. Simply look up a plant, add it to your plant list, and check your app daily. Empty Sills will provide you the information you need on soil, fertilization, and watering practises. With our app, we hope to take the difficulty out of gardening so that we can put an end to empty sills.
